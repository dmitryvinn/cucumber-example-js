# Cucumber Example - JavaScript
## Overview 
Similarly to [Cucumber Example - Java](https://github.com/dmitryvinn/cucumber-java-example), this repo is a part of [Gauge+Taiko: BDD for Web Revived](https://dvinnik.com/talks/testing/gauge-taiko-bdd-for-web-revived/).
With JavaScript being the primary language of the front-end, using JavaScript to write BDD tests makes collaboration that much easier. It reinforces Domain Driven Design practices such as Ubiquitous language by bridging the gap between stakeholders.

In this example, we use JavaScript to implement Cucumber BDD tests based on [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/examples/angularjs/#/) app.

**Note:** To properly run WebDriver tests in JS, you will require an appropriate driver to be accessible by the code. I found [this link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26191142/selenium-nodejs-chromedriver-path) fairly useful for ways to set driver path.
